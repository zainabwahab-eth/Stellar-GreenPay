## 🚨 Rollback Criteria

**Initiate rollback immediately if:**

- ❌ Preflight check fails (exit code 1)
- ❌ Application fails to start
- ❌ Critical errors in first 5 minutes
- ❌ Smart contract interactions failing
- ❌ Database corruption detected
- ❌ Security vulnerability discovered
- ❌ Performance degradation >50%
- ❌ Data loss or inconsistency

---

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

If rollback is needed:

1. **Stop Current Deployment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.mainnet.yml down
   ```

2. **Restore Previous Version**
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-stable-tag>
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.mainnet.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Restore Database (if needed)**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL < backup-pre-deployment.sql
   ```

4. **Verify Rollback**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/mainnet-preflight.sh
   curl -f https://api.greenpay.example.com/health
   ```

5. **Post-Mortem**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Identify root cause
   - Update deployment checklist
   - Schedule retry after fixes

## 🎯 Final Reminder

**NEVER deploy to mainnet if:**
